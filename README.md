# Node.js Fundamentals & Mini Project: Notifications with Timestamps

## üìö About This Project

This mini project was created as part of my self-study to explore the core functionalities of **Node.js**, including working with packages, the file system, command-line arguments, and real-time notification tools.

In this project, we use:

-   [`node-notifier`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-notifier) to display desktop notifications.
-   [`moment`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/moment) to format and manage time and date easily.

## üß† What You Will Learn

-   How to initialize a Node.js project using `npm init`.
-   How to create and understand `package.json`.
-   How to use external Node.js packages.
-   How `process.argv` works and why we use `.slice(2)`.
-   How to pass arguments when running a Node.js file.
-   How to build a small program that sends desktop notifications with a formatted timestamp.
